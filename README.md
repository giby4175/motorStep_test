# motorStep_test

This project tests and measures how long the stepper motor can move on my platform.

**Motor:** OE005-00  
**Platform:** A 3D printer used as a motion stage (printing function disabled).

> **Working range:**
> The platform has an overall width of about**22 cm**
> The platform has an overall length of about **30 cm**, but only **22 cm** of that length is usable for motion.  
> The remaining ~8 cm is occupied by the base and mechanical structure, so the actual travel distance is limited accordingly.
